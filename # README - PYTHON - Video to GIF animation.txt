Here's a Python script that converts a video into a GIF using the moviepy library. You can install moviepy using:

bash
Copy code
pip install moviepy
Once installed, here's the code that converts a video to a GIF:

python
Copy code
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

# Load the video file
video_path = 'input_video.mp4'  # Replace with your video file path
output_gif_path = 'output_animation.gif'  # Output GIF file

# Load the video
clip = VideoFileClip(video_path)

# Optionally, you can reduce the size of the video by specifying a percentage (e.g., 0.5 for half size)
clip_resized = clip.resize(0.5)  # Adjust this as needed

# Convert to GIF
clip_resized.write_gif(output_gif_path)

print(f"GIF saved as {output_gif_path}")
Steps:
Replace 'input_video.mp4' with the path to your video file.
Optionally, resize the clip with .resize(0.5) to reduce the GIF size.
The script will save the GIF with the name 'output_animation.gif'.
This script should be easy to use, and the moviepy library handles the conversion smoothly. ðŸ˜Š
